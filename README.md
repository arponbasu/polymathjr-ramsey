# Polymath Jr. : The Ramsey Theory Project

Commit your code for the project here! Here's how we'll be using git: 

1. Clone the repo, so that you may push and pull changes. 
2. Create your own folder for your group. You'll be workshoping ideas / code in your own folder. We suggest you come up with a descriptive name for your folder so that others have an easier time navigating the directories. Your folder name could be the names of the collaborators working on the project, or the algorithm you're trying to implement, etc.  
3. Use version control! You can edit all your code on the `main` branch, but it's good practice to maintain your "best" version on the `main` branch while experimenting on a new different branches. 
  a. When you want to merge your branch into the `main` branch, create a new Pull Request on GitHUb. Moderators will review your code before it gets merged to the `main` branch. 
4. *Important:* Comment your code! It'll make both your life and any reader's life easier in the future for understanding the flow of your code.
