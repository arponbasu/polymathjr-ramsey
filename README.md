# Polymath Jr. : The Ramsey Theory Project

Commit your code for the project here! Here's how we'll be using git: 

1. Clone the repo, so that you may push and pull changes. 
2. Create your own folder titled `firstname-lastname`. You'll be workshoping ideas / code in your own folder. 
3. Use version control! You can edit all your code on the `main` branch, but it's good practice to maintain your "best" version on the `main` branch while experimenting on a new different branches.
